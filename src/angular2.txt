    2. Hides data binding (the complex part in building a web application)
    3. Let's the developer focus on design and architecture
    4. Comes with a cost

Angular 2
    "Angular 2 is dramatically faster than Angular 1 with support for fast initial loads through server-side pre-rendering,
    offline compile for fast startup, and ultrafast change detection and view caching for smooth virtual scrolling
    and snappy view transitions"

It's a new framework

Syntax:
    1. Angular 2 syntax - html only (with comparison to angular 1)
